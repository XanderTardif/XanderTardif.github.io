<h2>*Samples of things I've worked on</h2>
<p>I have not done much programming but I've worked on a flappy bird knock-off. <br> I've also done some pixel art for a game called Apart!</p>

<h2>*resume</h2>
I am currently employed at Best Buy but as a way to reduce foot traffic in store, the application process is done online and as a result of that I do not have a resume.
